# AGENTS.md - Hybrid Workspace

Universal guidance for AI agents in hybrid workspaces — production agent quality without worktrees or planning overhead.

**Hybrid = full agent delegation chain + no worktrees + no planning phase + no CONTEXT.md**

## 🚨 ORCHESTRATOR: NEVER IMPLEMENT CODE DIRECTLY

The orchestrator NEVER writes code, tests, or file edits — not even "small" ones.

❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Writing tests, editing source files, fixing bugs inline, "just quickly" adding anything

✅ **ONLY allowed**: Loading rules, reading context, creating session log, delegating to subagents, committing after all gates pass

**Any code or tests → delegate to feature-developer immediately. No exceptions.**

## 🚨 ORCHESTRATOR: ALWAYS RUN THE FULL CYCLE

**After feature-developer completes — immediately, without stopping or asking:**

1. **Identify the step's gate** — what test suite proves this works? CI alone? Write it in the session log.
2. → **verification-engineer** (runs `make ci` AND the step's gate)
3. → **code-reviewer** (only after "ALL CLEAR ✅")
4. → **commit** (only after "✅ QUALITY APPROVED")
5. → **continue to next step** — do NOT stop after committing

**No exceptions.** One-line change? Full cycle. Runtime.exs tweak? Full cycle.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Load Rules FIRST

On EVERY session start:

1. **LOAD** `./codegen/rules/orchestration/delegation-patterns.md` and `./codegen/rules/orchestration/user-communication.md`
2. **READ** `./codegen/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`

## Workspace Rules

- Work in current directory only (never `../`)
- No worktrees — commit directly to main
- No planning phase — implement from task description directly

## 📊 Session Logging

**Orchestrator** creates the session log as FIRST action. **Subagents append** — never create separate files.

**WHERE**: `./codegen/logging/$(date -u +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_session.md`

See `shared/session-management.md` for the complete log format.

## Agent Roles & Workflow

```
feature-developer → verification-engineer → code-reviewer → orchestrator commits
```

- **feature-developer**: Implements feature + tests (TDD), updates PROJECT_CONTEXT.md before reporting done
- **verification-engineer**: Runs `make ci`, reports ALL failures, never fixes code
- **code-reviewer**: Reviews quality/patterns/architecture, reports issues
- **orchestrator**: Uses `Skill("commit")` after all gates pass

## 🔄 MANDATORY: Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md Before Handoff

feature-developer MUST update before reporting done: new modules → Module Directory, changed patterns → relevant section, new pitfalls → Common Pitfalls.

## CI Setup

**`make ci`**: compile → deps.unlock → deps.audit → hex.audit → sobelow → format + prettier → credo --strict → dialyzer → test --cover → ecto.rollback

## Universal Requirements

- **Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md first** — always, before any work
- **Issue Discovery → Immediate Fixing** — find issues, fix them, never just document
- **Session logging** — orchestrator creates, subagents append
- **Update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md before done** — feature-developer must update before handoff
